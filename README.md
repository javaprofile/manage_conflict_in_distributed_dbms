**Abstract:**\
This paper addresses performance degradation in distributed database systems caused by high transaction conflict rates. It examines how concurrent access to shared data under Snapshot Isolation leads to write-write conflicts, increased transaction aborts, and reduced throughput. The study emphasizes the role of Multi-Version Concurrency Control in managing consistency while enabling concurrent transaction execution across distributed nodes. By maintaining multiple data versions and isolating transactions effectively, this approach reduces conflicts and improves system performance. The paper highlights the need for efficient, conflict-aware concurrency control mechanisms in large-scale distributed database environments.

**Key Contributions:**
* **Conflict Rate Reduction:**\
Developed a conflict management approach using Multi-Version Concurrency Control to reduce transaction interference in distributed database systems.

* **Concurrency Control Enhancement:**\
Analyzed limitations of Snapshot Isolation and addressed write-write conflicts and write skew anomalies in high-concurrency environments.
  
* **Performance Evaluation:** \
  Assessed the impact of conflict rates on transaction aborts, throughput, and latency under write-intensive workloads.
  
* **Research Leadership:**\
  Led the study and implementation focusing on improving consistency and performance in distributed databases through advanced concurrency control techniques.

**Relevance & Real-World Impact**
* **CPU Resource Optimization:**\
Improved processing efficiency in big data systems by addressing imbalance in CPU distribution using containerization and control groups.

* **Intelligent Scheduling Integration:**\
Applied machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques to dynamically allocate CPU resources based on workload patterns, enhancing throughput and reliability.

* **Academic Recognition :** \
    Recognized in technical analyses and academic investigations focused on DNS resolution strategies and performance tuning in distributed systems.
* **Educational Impact:** \
    Findings utilized in programs and research efforts, supporting continued exploration of container orchestration and cloud system optimization.
